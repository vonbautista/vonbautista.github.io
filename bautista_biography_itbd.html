	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>.My name is Von Clareon Bautista. <sup>2</sup>I spent my childhood in our province in Rizal, particularly in Binangonan. <sup>3</sup>My childhood is full of joy and laughter. <sup>4</sup>Everyday, I wake up every 9 am in the morning, and watch television. <sup>5</sup>I always watch DragonBall, Pokemon and Doraemon. <sup>6</sup>Life then was less stressful and carefree. <sup>1</sup>I am always playing with my childhood buddies. <sup>7</sup>Specifically pitcha, ice-ice-water and piko. <sup>8</sup>Me and my childhood playmates tend to buy all junk foods in the sari-sari store and then put it in a plate and we have a little picnic together. <sup>9</sup>One day, those days suddenly disappeared. <sup>10</sup>As we grow older, the technology is growing bigger and better. <sup>11</sup>We were all too busy playing gadgets and we outgrow playing outside. <sup>12</sup>My childhood is something that I can never forget. <sup>13</sup>One of my most memorable memory of my childhood is when I spent it with my grandfather. <sup>14</sup>I love him so much. <sup>15</sup>He used to give me money for my merienda everyday. <sup>16</sup>He always gives me toys and he takes care of us siblings. <sup>17</sup>Not until he bacame ill and eventually passed away. <sup>18</sup>I'm missing him everyday and I remember so much of my childhood because of him.<sup>19</sup> This childhood taught me time is of the essense. <sup>20</sup>I believe in saying "Minsan lang tayo maging bata", that's why we should cherish everything about it.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Teenage years is one of the most complicated years in my life. <sup>2</sup>I learned so many things as I grow up, I become more curious about everything. <sup>3</sup>I experience happiness, sadness, laughter, everything. <sup>4</sup>Highschool days is indeed the most life-challenging path. <sup>5</sup>Teenage years lets me decide what path I should take. <sup>6</sup>Is it the bad or the good one. <sup>7</sup>Choosing your companion wisely can get you there. <sup>8</sup>Choose your friends wisely. <sup>9</sup>In my teenage years, many of us failed, but still get up. <sup>10</sup>Many of us succeeded and still there at the top. <sup>11</sup>Teenage years for me is a turning point. <sup>12</sup>I learned many things I should'nt have learned. <sup>13</sup>My friends taught me how to drink alcohol and do many things. <sup>14</sup>But that is not a hindrance for me to continue moving forward. <sup>15</sup>In my teenage years, I made these bad habits as a motivation for me to do better for myself. <sup>16</sup>For example, if I get high grades for this semester, I'm gonna spend my night enjoying with my friends. <sup>17</sup>Self-discipline is really needed for us to succeed in life. <sup>18</sup>They say that teenage years is the best years of our lives.<sup>19</sup>I agree to that statement because I learned so much from my teenage years. <sup>20</sup>In teenage years, you will lose many friends and that's fine.<sup>21</sup>In college, the real ones will come.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>College years is the most exhausting point in my life right now. <sup>2</sup>Back then, I live in the province where its so comfortable to live in. <sup>3</sup>Its so peaceful back then. <sup>4</sup>When I turned college, it's like everything changed. <sup>5</sup>Living in Manila is sad for me because I have to leave everything. <sup>6</sup>I have to leave my home, my family, my dog. <sup>7</sup>But it made me think more, I'm doing this because of them. <sup>8</sup>This sadness can will be filled up with happiness once I finished this college. <sup>9</sup>I'm just making my family my inspiration for me to get up everyday and fight. <sup>10</sup>College has a lot of lessons in life. <sup>11</sup>It taught us friendship, perseverance and dedication. <sup>12</sup>All my life, I was reliant and dependent to my mother.<sup>13</sup>Eversince I left for college, I am always alone and independent.<sup>14</sup>It's been a challenge for me but from all the support that I am receiving from my family, I can do it.<sup>15</sup>On my first week here in Manila, I was travelling for 3 hours from my home to Manila.<sup>16</sup>But then my mother told me that I can't study well when I'm going home in the province everyday.<sup>17</sup>That's why they provided me a house and everything just for me to graduate from college.<sup>18</sup>In college, Im always hungry, tired and sleepless.<sup>19</sup>But I know, everything will be worth it once I finished this course.<sup>20</sup>Life will teach us that when we fall, it's either we lay down or stand up and be strong.
